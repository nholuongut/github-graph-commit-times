This Golang program generates a graphical representation (SVG) of commit activity by hour for any number of GitHub
repositories.

It can also filter commits by a specific user or email.

There is also a similar version in Bash in the
[nholuongut/devops-bash-tools](https://github.com/nholuongut/devops-bash-tools) repo.

## Features

- Fetch commits from multiple GitHub repositories
- Visualize commits by hour (0-23)
- Option to filter commits by username or email
- Saves output as an SVG graph

## Run

```shell
go run main.go <username>
```

eg.

```shell
go run main.go nholuongut
```

## Build

To compile a portable binary:

```shell
make build
```

### Run Binary

Will fetch all public non-fork repos and for each one the commit log to generate the commits for the graph.

```shell
./github-graph-commit-times nholuongut
```

## Result

`graph.svg`:

![Commit Hours Graph](graph.svg)

## Caveats

### GitHub API returns Times in UTC

...and there is no way to know the original timezone of the programmer this way.

Scripts `git/git_graph_commit_times_*.sh` that generate graphs from local git repo checkouts in the
[DevOps-Bash-tools](https://github.com/nholuongut/devops-bash-tools) repo will get local timezone hours from the local
`git log` in each checkout, but this only works if you have all the repos checked out locally so requires much more
admin than querying the GitHub API.
